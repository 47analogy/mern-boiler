# MERN Boilerplate

This is a MERN boilerplate that can be used as a starting point to create apps that don't use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To get started:

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/47analogy/mern-boiler.git
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

In one terminal, make sure that MongoDB is running

```
mongod
```

In a second terminal, run the client and server

```
npm run development
```

The application should be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
